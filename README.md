# dexaggregate-react

A simple explorer for aggregated market data served by [dexaggregate-elixir](https://github.com/jochenboesmans/dexaggregate-elixir).

Available scripts are:
* `start`: runs a webpack-dev-server serving the project locally.
* `build`: runs the production webpack build which it outputs in `/build`.
* `serve`: runs `yarn run build` and runs a node server serving the built static files.

You can replace `yarn` with `npm` in `package.json` to use the `serve` script with `npm`, or you can just make your own script.
